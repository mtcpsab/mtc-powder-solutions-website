          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <p>
            The basic idea is simple. Place fine metal powder in a gas-tight
            steel capsule, heat to elevated temperature (but below melting
            point), apply isostatic gas pressure and you get a very strong,
            solid, 100% dense shape with practically no inclusions. The
            encapsulated powder can be HIPed to produce Near-Net Shapes (NNS) of
            virtually any geometry. Not only does this offer more design freedom
            than forging or casting, it reduces the risk of hydrogen-induced
            stress cracking (HISC) in duplex stainless steels, since the process
            results in a material with very fine microstructure. It also
            eliminates the risk of any defects like cracks, porosity or
            stringers. By avoiding time-consuming welding and inspections in the
            forging-machining process, or weld repair in the casting process,
            you reduce risk and lead-time costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The production process from the melt to the finished product takes
            place in four stages.

      <h3>1. Melting and atomization</h3>
      <p>
        The melt produced in an induction furnace is tapped into an
        induction-heated ladle where further alloying elements can be added in a
        protective atmosphere. The ladle also permits stirring and temperature
        control of the melt throughout the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the melt is tapped from the bottom of the ladle it is discharged
        directly into the atomization chamber. The molten steel is broken up by
        jets of inert gas and the atomized melt solidifies into small spherical
        particles of high purity and low oxygen content and with a diameter less
        than 500 micron. The powder is stored under inert gas
        hermetically-sealed vessels.

      reverse=true >}}
      <h3>2. Canning</h3>
      <p>
        The powder is canned in capsules of mild steel, which are produced by
        sheet metal forming and welding. The capsule is designed to give the
        fully dense end product to the desired shape. Compound products can be
        produced by designing capsules with separate compartments for different
        powders, enclosing parts of solid material together with powder or by
        other proprietary processes.

      imagecaption="HIP" >}}
      <h3>3. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP)</h3>
      <p>
        The evacuated and sealed capsules are placed in a hot isostatic press
        where they are subjected to high pressure and temperatures. The hot
        isostatic pressing parameters are predetermined to give the material
        full density.

      reverse=true >}}
      <h3>4. Post treatment</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on the type of material and the application, the PM HIP
        products will be heat treated, machined and subjected to various types
        of quality control, such as ultrasonic inspection, dye penetrant
        testing, testing of mechanical properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mild steel sheet used in the can remains on the product after the
        hot isostatic pressing and heat treatment and is either removed by
        machining or pickling.

            <p>
              MTC products produced by powder metallurgically based hot
              isostatic pressing (PM HIP) are available in a wide range of
              materials, for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Austenitic stainless steels</li>
              <li>Duplex stainless steels</li>
              <li>Martensitic steels</li>
              <li>Metal matrix composites (MMC)</li>
              <li>Nickel alloys</li>
              <li>Tool steels</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The maximum dimension after hot isostatic pressing is a diameter
              of 1800 mm and a height of 3550mm The maximum weight for a single
              HIP product is approximately 25 tonnes.
