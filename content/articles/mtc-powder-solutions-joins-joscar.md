MTC Powder Solutions is now part of JOSCAR (the Joint Supply Chain Accreditation Register) a collaborative tool used by the aerospace, defence and security industry. One of the key aims of JOSCAR is to ensure that the information that we are asked to provide to clients pin points the information needed. A dynamic two-stage process is used to ensure that the process is tailored, and therefore as efficient as possible.

Stage 1 collects basic information to be evaluated to move to the next stage if applicable to the customers services needed desire. Stage 2 then requires the completion of more detailed information along with supporting evidence. The whole process is made more efficient and effective through tailor made selection and information giving.

MTC Powder Solutions can now benefit as a supplier demonstrating compliance to multiple customers and offer direct support to customersâ€™ needs effectively.
