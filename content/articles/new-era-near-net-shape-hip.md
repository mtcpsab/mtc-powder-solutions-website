The pristine MTC Powder Solutions AB flags raised at the Near-Net Shape (NNS) HIP production unit in Surahammar marked a new chapter in the history books of NNS HIP components today. On March 3, 2020, Metal Technology Co. Ltd (MTC) signed a share transfer agreement to acquire all the shares of Sandvik Powder Solutions AB (SPS), the acquisition was completed by mid-April and the integration of the new company into the MTC family is fully underway.

Over the last two months all our employees have worked hard to maintain a seamlessly smooth continuation of business despite the added challenges that integration into a new owner can bring. The change of ownership has been well received by our valued existing customer base and we continue to provide the trust and support our customers value and expect. This has been confirmed by multiple new orders for demanding projects since the establishment of MTC PS and encouraging further investment in the future.

> _"We want to take the opportunity to thank our customers for their continued trust in the company and we are thankful to have them onboard in our exciting journey that lays ahead"_, declared Magnus Nyström, Managing Director at MTC Powder Solutions AB.

An exciting journey that started a few years ago as a collaboration on multiple large and complex projects between then SPS and MTC. SPS manufactured high quality HIP canisters prepared and ready for MTC to Hot Isostatic Press (HIP) in the world’s largest HIP autoclave.

> _"From the initial stages of the collaboration we could identify a variety of complementary strengths in different fields between the two companies that aligned very well. We are now seeing these come through into a real connection of two cultures"_, commented Iain Dandy, New Business Development Manager at MTC Powder Solutions AB.

It’s the various strengths of the two companies that will now be utilized and combined to extend the capability of MTC PS and create synergies between the companies that will take NNS HIP into a new era. A new era which is moreover fueled by the rapid transition from a traditionally manufacturing mentality to a more disruptive additive manufacturing mentality.

MTC PS is not only well prepared for this kind of transition, but is also driven by ambitious plans for the future and highly motivated employees. So stay tuned to hear more exciting news in the future!
