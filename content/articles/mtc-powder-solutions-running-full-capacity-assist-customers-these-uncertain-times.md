Despite the challenges presented to all of us at this difficult time MTC Powder Solutions is striving to maintain production at full capacity whilst allocating priority to the safety of our employees, our business partners, and in ensuring the prevention of the spread of infection. We are closely monitoring the recommendations from the public health agency and are following these recommendations to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The safety measures recommended by the authorities are continuously reviewed and implemented by MTC Powder Solutions management.

While many areas in the world are being brought to a standstill MTC Powder Solutions recognizes that our customers and their projects continue to try to run unaffected and need reliable sources at this crucial time. MTC Powder Solutions is supporting customers by maintaining the Swedish production site for its Near-Net Shaped HIP components at full capacity without any reduction in working hours.

MTC recognize its importance in major projects and will continue to strive to run the production with the highest priority of safety but still deliver high quality products on time to our valuable customers.

Metal Technology Co. Ltd. (Japan) has also been bringing the fight to Covid-19 and produced face shields and 3D Additive Manufacturing data for the face shields for others to utilize. See the link below for more information.
