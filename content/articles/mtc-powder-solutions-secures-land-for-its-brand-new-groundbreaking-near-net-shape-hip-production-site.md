The active Shin (進) project took another leap forward and completed another important milestone in the construction of the new game changing Near-Net Shape Hot Isostatic Pressing (**NNS HIP**) factory. Whilst the current factory in Surahammar has enjoyed a huge amount of success and support for the NNS HIP business, MTC Powder Solutions (**MTC PS**) have now secured the acquisition of a large site in the nearby region of Hallstahammar in Sweden. 

The designated site will be significantly larger than the current site supporting the recent purchase of a large Ø1600mm by 3500mm state-of-the-art HIP unit and facilitate the expansion of our Powder Metallurgy HIP (**PM HIP**) capabilities throughout the whole of Europe.  

> The increased demand for our PM HIP materials in highly demanding industries has made us outgrow our current facility. As a consequence, to be able to increase the capacity at the same rate, we saw that the next natural step was to move to a much larger and new site. **Commented Magnus Nyström, CEO at MTC Powder Solutions**  

It has taken months of evaluations and checks with the local authority supporting the company’s desire to find a sustainable, and suitable site for the PM HIP business and the local areas. The site has excellent access to transport and features the opportunity for the design of a tailor-made NNS HIP factory for the future. MTC will take every opportunity to utilize this for the benefit of both valuable existing customers and new customers in efficiency and production flow, but also for the environment and the local area. Working together to reach a positive impact on the community creating multiple new job opportunities for additional skilled workers from the surrounding areas.
