MTC Powder Solutions (MTC PS) has kicked-off production on Super Duplex Stainless Steel (SDSS) components produced by Near-Net Shape Hot Isostatic Pressing (NNS HIP) for one major Oil & Gas project with a steel-cutting ceremony at its production site in Surahammar, Sweden.

The ceremony marks the beginning of production of SDSS NNS HIP components which will have a critical function in equipment used to collect O&G from various wells situated deep on the seabed. HIP Super Duplex materials are continuing to be the first choice for components which are utilized in harsh environments where a long-life design and resistance to HISC are essential.

> “We are thankful as once more we have been successful in securing an important contract that marks the continued trust in our ability to deliver critical components to important projects in the O&G industry.” **Commented Jimmy Bovin, Global Product Manager at MTC PS.**

The start of production also comes just a few hours after completion of the design, one benefit achieved from our recent investment in the sheet metal workshop making it possible to decrease the time between engineering work being completed and the first steel-cut.  

> “These are the types of big wins we are looking for now at MTC PS. Fantastic work by the whole team.” **Added Tetsuhito Hirayama, Chairman of the Board of Directors**
