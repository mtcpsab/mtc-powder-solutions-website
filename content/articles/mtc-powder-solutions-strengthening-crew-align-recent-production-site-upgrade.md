Following the recent announcement regarding the production site upgrade from MTC Powder Solutions (MTC PS) we are happy to announce that the team at MTC PS production site in Surahammar, Sweden has also been strengthened with five new additional employees. The newly employed personnel are spread between the complete value chain; sales, design, project management, and production to strengthen the whole company meeting increased demands.

With the immense hype of additive manufacturing introducing a new design mentality across multiple industries more and more existing designs are challenged and the interest for _Powder Metallurgy Near-Net Shape Hot Isostatic Pressing (PM NNS HIP)_ components is increasing.

> _“It was a natural step to increase the capacity in our design department with one permanent additional design engineer to align with our customers increased demand for rapid design input in a variety of developments. As reducing cost becomes more and more evident in most sectors; we see a clear tendency that customers are relying more on our competence as a PM NNS HIP manufacturer to suggest changes on existing and new applications. Changes which support increased performance and reduced project costs”_ Commented **Fredrik Johansson- Technical Manager at MTC PS.**

MTC PS continues to invest in the future and strive to align to customers’ needs to be the stand out and preferred partner for NNS HIP components.
