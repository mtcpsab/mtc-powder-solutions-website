MTC Powder Solutions (MTC PS) recently invested in a fiber laser cutting machine to increase the capability onsite for MTC PS. This purchase will play an important role in the recently upgraded sheet metal workshop utilized for MTC PS’ Powder Metallurgy Near-Net Shape Hot Isostatic Pressed (PM NNS HIP) business segment. The laser cutter will be used to increase and expand the ability to cut sheet metal which is later formed and welded together to create a HIP capsule design close for PM NNS applications.

The current market situation is challenging for many and here at MTC PS we see a clear tendency that when projects are approved there is a huge drive to get the projects up and running as quickly as possible. Raw materials are usually the first step and lead times on forgings are therefore naturally a challenging factor within many project schedules. As a consequence, HIP:ed blanks then becomes the customers desired choice.

> _“As a manufacturer we are always thinking of ways to assist our customers in crucial projects and align our capabilities with customer’s needs, to invest in a new laser cutting machine, which will literally cut our lead times, was an natural next step._ ”  Commented **Jimmy Bovin, Global Product Manager at MTC PS**

The new machine will also play an important role in our ability to rapidly adjust designs based on lesson’s learned throughout the manufacturing process. Continuously improving efficiency and quality is something that our Japanese owner, Metal Technology Co. Ltd. (MTC), inherently pushes to the forefront to facilitate and enable positive development.

> “_As the amount of projects we are running are tied to product development in collaboration with key customers have increased this additional equipment gives us increased flexibility in making rapid prototyping for R&D projects easier._“ Commented **Tomas Berglund, Application Development Manager at MTC PS**

The industrial environment is undergoing a massive change and as such MTC PS is continuously reevaluating and realigning to be a preferred collaboration partner and supplier of NNS HIP components.
