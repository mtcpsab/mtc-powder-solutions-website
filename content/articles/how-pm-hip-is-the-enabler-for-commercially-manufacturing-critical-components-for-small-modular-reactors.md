Nobody can have missed the focus around Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) as a key solution to solve the energy mix challenge when moving away from fossil fuels. Renewables will, of course, continue to develop be an important part. However, the use of nuclear power provides the steady and reliable stream of electricity needed to run and grow an advanced economy, and to enable developing countries to boost economic output and raise living standard. 

As IAEA stated in their Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments 2020 SMR book, the key driving forces of SMR development are fulfilling the need for flexible power generation for a wider range of users and applications, replacing ageing fossil-fired units, enhancing safety performance, and offering better economic affordability.  SMRs can help solve one of the more highlighted challenges with conventional nuclear power plants; huge fabrications with high levels of complexity which makes them CAPEX heavy, and time from investment decision to actual operational commencement is very long. SMRs have a smaller footprint, and are serial manufactured in factories rather than on large sites, making them quicker to produce and less costly. 

The use of Powder Metallurgy Near-Net Shape Hot Isostatic Pressing (PM NNS HIP) for the fabrication of SMR component would not only reduce cost, but also shorten leadtime, enhance quality and reduce risk. This by reducing the number of welded areas, the number of components needed, and a reduction in wasteful machining. Further taking advantage of the possibilities with HIP complicated and risky processes like cladding and dissimilar metal welds could potentially also be eliminated. This more sustainable mindset places PM HIP in a key position for the manufacturing of SMRs. The fundamental benefits from this technology have made PM HIP irreplaceable in many critical applications in other industries over the years. Many parallels can be seen in already established industries and the SMR segment making PM HIP an enabler to produce commercially viable SMRs to the highest quality standards. 

It’s not new news that when it comes to material integrity, PM HIP is used in many critical applications, like production valves and special fittings, due to the high cleanliness and isotropic properties compared to conventional manufactured materials. In addition to this, removing welds by combining multiple components with the use of PM HIP means a reduction in vulnerable areas in the assemblies as the material properties of the welds are often worse than the base material. Therefore, it’s clear that NNS HIP components ultimately increase the integrity of the component in question.

Some SMRs also use very corrosive medias, such as molten salt, which drives the material choice towards highly exotic alloys which could be difficult to produce with conventional manufacturing technologies. Consequently, this makes PM HIP the prime candidate to increase manufacturability in combination with the advantages which reduce fabrication steps.
