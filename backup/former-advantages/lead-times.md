## Cut lead times in half
Are you in a hurry? Maybe you need just a few components and cannot wait half a year for a forging or casting house to fulfill your order? Let’s face it, it takes time to make the molds or to do the welding and machining from a non-standard metal section. Instead, by relying on powder-based production, we can deliver in 10-12 weeks – or roughly half the time.

## Reduce net working capital (NWC)
Capital outlays for items like dies or molds are often high and can tie up your working capital. By cutting delivery times and removing a lot of labor-intensive machining, welding and other fabrication steps, you can move more cash into your balance sheet – with less out there in the production flow.

## Flexibility in design and manufacturing
When you design for HIP production, you automatically gain many flexible advantages: shorter lead times, flexibility in designing complex shapes, fewer processing steps and less waste. Heavy machining or roughing operations are eliminated, welding is reduced, and finish machining is kept to a minimum, leading to lower risk of scrapping. But we also encourage you to challenge our flexibility in terms of project management. What would an optimal process look like for you? Could we provide design suggestions early on? Let’s collaborate closely.

## Project management and document control
When you commission a HIP component from us, you gain access to one contact person with one team and one ambition: to deliver your component in perfect condition, on budget, on time. Customers all over the world give our project management team high marks for our seamless step-by-step process – from design, modeling and metallurgical expertise to heat treatment, quality assurance, testing, documentation and delivery. And we hold to our delivery times!

The HIP process is like baking a cake: it’s about what you do before and after the HIP-process that really counts. This is where our experienced materials and design experts can add significant value – from discussions on design optimization (could you use thinner walls?) to providing regular status reports and comprehensive quality assurance documentation.
